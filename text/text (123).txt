     You have the bullwhip coiled in your back pocket, so you decide to drop.
If the lions attack, you’ll whip them!
     You let go of Geyorg’s costume. With your arms stretched out wide, you
sail down to the trampoline below.
   BOING!
   You hit the trampoline dead center — and bounce back up!
   Perfect!
   BOING!
   You’re up in the air … then down …
   BOING!
   It’s fun! Too much fun.
    So much fun that you forget that Mistress Barbarous and all her evil
relatives are trying to kill you!
   Then — THWAP!
   A knife breezes past you, almost slicing your ear.
   Keep bouncing and turn to PAGE 61.
