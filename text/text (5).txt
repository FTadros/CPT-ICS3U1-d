    You decide to face the dangers on the floor. You take a deep breath to
steel yourself. “Ready,” you murmur.
   Time to deal with the lions, the knife thrower, Mistress Barbarous — and
whatever else is out to get you!
    You grip the bullwhip tightly as you jump off the trampoline. You land on
the dirt floor.
   “GRRRRR!” the lions growl hungrily.
   The hairs on the back of your neck prickle.
   The three furry beasts circle you. They look ravenous.
     “In the center ring!” Mistress Barbarous announces over her microphone.
“It’s today’s main attraction — lunch!”
    You rub your sweaty forehead with the back of your hand. “Hup!” you
yell, cracking your whip at the lions.
   The lions back away a step.
   But the knife thrower doesn’t.
   WHHHSSSSSHH! A knife sails so close to your head, it parts your hair.
You can’t help screaming!
   Keep your nerves steady until you reach PAGE 16.
