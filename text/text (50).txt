   You don’t have your lucky baseball cap. Tough luck!
   You’ll have to rely on your wits instead!
   In the puzzle below, the word LIONS is written forwards, backwards, up,
and down.
   Circle all the lions. Then count them.
   After you count them, multiply by four.
   That’s the page number you should turn to next.
   If you find all the lions and do the math correctly, you’ll be very lucky.
There’s a hint waiting for you on the correct page!
   But if you get the wrong answer …
    Ooooh. Bad luck. You’ll turn to a page that makes no sense at all for this
part of the story. And then you’ll be hopelessly lost in the book!
   Good luck!




   Follow the instructions. Then turn to the correct page.
