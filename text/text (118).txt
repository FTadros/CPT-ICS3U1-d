    As you stare, Mistress Barbarous brings her horse to a halt and slides off
to the ground. Then she suddenly throws her hands up to cover her face.
   You back away from her. The pendant is safe in your fist.
   “Noooooo! It’s happening!” she moans. “You! You’ve ruined
everything….”
   Your mouth falls open in shock as smoke billows up from Mistress
Barbarous’s body.
    Right in front of you, Mistress Barbarous begins to change shape. First
she shrinks in size. Then fur sprouts all over her body! Then she falls forward
onto all fours.
   “I can’t believe it!” you murmur.
   Mistress Barbarous has turned into a weasel! A coal-black weasel!
   She bares her sharp teeth at you, then darts away.
   Richie drops down from the ceiling on a rope.
   “What is going on?” Richie asks. “I’ve never seen anything like it. Ever!”
   All around you, Mistress Barbarous’s relatives are changing shape.
Changing into animals!
   Watch them transform on PAGE 104.
