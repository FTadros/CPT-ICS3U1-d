   You dash into the big tent and glance around.
   Empty. Quiet. No knife thrower.
   Good! You sling your backpack over one shoulder and wonder what to do
next.
   That’s when you feel something drop onto your head.
   You put your hand up and cautiously touch your hair.
   Yuck! It’s wet! Just a drop, but slimy!
   Who’s above you? Someone is up there in the dark at the top of the tent,
dropping slimy goop into your hair!
   You tilt your head back and gaze up.
    A figure is perched on a small wooden platform. The platform that the
trapeze artists swing from.
   From the way he’s crouching, you’re afraid he’s going to drop on you at
any moment!
   Better move — and fast! — to PAGE 65.
