    Barbarous? You gulp. You and your mom met the ringmistress of the
circus outside. She seemed sweet and friendly.
   But she doesn’t sound so sweet now!
   “Hurry up!” her voice booms over the microphone.
   “Come on, Richie!” you exclaim. “We’d better get down there!”
   You hustle down the dim aisle. Richie follows reluctantly behind you.
You toss your backpack down on a chair in the front row and step onto the
sawdust-covered floor of the main ring. Richie plops down in a chair.
    Suddenly the lights snap on. Bright, glaring lights that almost blind you.
In the next instant, a curtain swings back. Mistress Barbarous steps out
holding a cordless microphone. She is wearing black leather pants, a red satin
blouse, and a snug black vest. She smiles wickedly at you and claps her hands
three times.
   “Let the fun begin!” she bellows into the microphone.
    From behind her, a man in a black cape rides into the ring, standing on a
horse.
   He’s carrying a huge silver knife!
   And he’s pointing it at you!
