   You dart to the left.
  “Aaaahhhhhhh!” you scream, watching the huge clown flip in the air.
WHAM! He hits the ground right where you were standing a second ago.
   Phew. You’re safe!
   Or are you?
   “Run!” Mr. Peepers urges you. “Get out of here before he kills you!”
   You glance at the huge clown on the ground.
   His elastic arms have begun to stretch out again! Toward your throat!
   You scramble to your feet and take off.
   “And watch out for Mistress Barbarous,” the pudgy clown calls after you.
“She and her whole family. They’re bad. They do things….”
    His voice trails off behind you as you dash back to the big tent. Toward
the exit. It seems like the best place to run.

knife thrower was trying to kill you!
