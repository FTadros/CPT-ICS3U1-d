    The coin comes up heads, so you lurch to the right to avoid the giant
slipping-and-sliding clown.
   Oops. Wrong way.
   “Whoa!” the clown cries as his feet fly up in the air.
   With a huge, groaning crash, he comes down on top of you.
   SPLAT.
   You’d like to cry “Ouch!” but you can’t.
   You’d like to tell him to get off you — but you can’t.
   You’d even like to start this book over and forget about the bananas next
time….
   Hey, now that’s something you can do!
                                 THE END
