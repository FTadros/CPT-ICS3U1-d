   The flashing knife reminds you that you’re in terrible trouble. Here’s what
you’re up against:
   1) Morton the Knife Thrower is trying to kill you.
   2) The twin trapeze artists are lurking above.
   3) Geyorg the Clown wants to crunch you.
   4) The lions are waiting to tear you to shreds.
   You’ve got problems! You’d better think fast and decide what to do.
   Should you jump off the trampoline? On the floor you’ll be able to use the
whip on the animals — and on the knife thrower, too.
    Or should you keep bouncing on the trampoline and try to bounce so high
that you’re out of reach? You see an empty trapeze above you. Maybe you
can reach it….
   THWAP! The knives keep coming! Hurry!
   To keep bouncing, turn to PAGE 91.
   If you think you can handle the lions, turn to PAGE 7.
