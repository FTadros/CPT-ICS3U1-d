   You decide to keep bouncing. Higher … higher …
   You throw your whole body into the next bounce.
    Your arms circle around like windmills. Your legs push hard as they hit
the trampoline.
   It works. You sail into the air. Up … up …
   Yes! You’ve bounced high enough to reach the trapeze swing!
   You grip it with your hands. Then you somersault to a sitting position.
   THWAP! Another knife sails by, underneath you.
   “Ha!” you taunt the knife thrower. “You can’t reach me! I’m too high!”
   You laugh as Morton hurls one knife after another at you. They all fall
short of the target.
   But we have news for you.
   You laughed too soon.
   Stop laughing on PAGE 111.
