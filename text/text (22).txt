   Congratulations! You spotted all the lions and did the math correctly! You
may not be lucky — but you’re smart!
   You didn’t need that lucky baseball cap after all.
   For your reward, you get to survive being knocked over by the lion.
   You also get three hints.
    Hint #1: When you choose your objects again at the start of the book, take
the thing that helps people to get a good look at themselves.
   Hint #2: Running from danger almost never gets you anywhere.
   Hint #3: When you go out in the sun, wear sunscreen. This won’t help
you get through this book, but it will help you in real life!
    Now go back to PAGE 2 and begin the adventure again. And don’t even
think about taking your lucky baseball cap if you want to outsmart Mistress
Barbarous in
                                 THE END.
