   You brought bananas from home. Luckily, you stuck one in your pocket.
    You can barely speak, because the giant clown is choking you. But you
reach into your pocket and pull out the banana.
   You toss it to the pudgy clown.
   “Just a banana?” the clown complains. “No chocolate?”
   “You said you’d help,” you choke out.
    “Yeah, yeah.” Mr. Peepers peels the banana, eats it, and tosses the peel to
the ground in front of the huge, evil clown.
    “Hey, look at me!” Mr. Peepers yells. Then he deliberately steps on the
peel. He slips and lands with a dramatic SPLAT!
   “Ha-ha!” the huge clown laughs, letting go of your throat.
   You fall to the ground, gasping for air.
   You’re so psyched that you’re free!
   But then the huge clown takes a step forward and slips on the banana peel
himself.
   “Whoops!” he cries in delight, falling.
   Falling … falling … falling your way!
   Try to dodge him on PAGE 87.
