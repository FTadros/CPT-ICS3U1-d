    You don’t like Bostini, but you’re too nice to stand around and watch a
person being torn to shreds.
   Fearlessly, you crack your bullwhip at the lion.
   The beast flinches and growls at you. But then it rolls off Bostini and
saunters to the side of the ring.
   “Excellent!” you congratulate yourself.
    “Don’t get smart, circus kid!” Mistress Barbarous shouts at you. She puts
her fingers to her mouth and whistles.
    Immediately, a tall white horse gallops into the ring. Barbarous jumps up
and stands on its back. “I’m going to get another mirror,” she calls as she
rides toward an exit. “Then you’ll be sorry you ever touched that whip!”
   “If she gets another mirror you’re as good as dead!” Richie calls down
from above. “She uses it for her magic!”
   Uh-oh. He’s right. If she gets another mirror …
   Hey! Do you have a mirror?
   If you brought the mirror with you, turn to PAGE 95.
   If you didn’t, turn to PAGE 45.
