    Luckily the huge gray thing with the trunk outside the tent isn’t an
elephant. It’s a car! A newspaper reporter’s car!
   “Help!” you scream. “Get me out of here!”
   “What’s up, kid?” the newspaper reporter asks.
   “This place is a nightmare!” you shout. “Get me out of here, and I’ll give
you a great story!”
    The reporter drives you straight to the newspaper office. You tell him all
about the horrible circus. You show him the photos of the Lizard Boy and the
other sideshow creatures.
   “Wow,” the reporter says. “This is a front-page story!”
   You’re so glad you’re safe and that the newspaper staff believe your story.
You were worried that they’d laugh at you.
   No one laughs at you … until the paper comes out the next day. Then
your whole town has a good chuckle at your expense.
   You didn’t give your story to a real newspaper. You gave it to one of those
cheap supermarket tabloids.
   The headline reads: KID FINDS LIZARD TWIN AT THE CIRCUS!
   It shows a photo of you right next to a shot of the Lizard Boy.
   Let’s just call you Lizardo from now on. Everyone else does!
                                  THE END
