    “Ah, here’s the switch!” Mistress Barbarous exclaims.
    CLICK! Bright lights illuminate the sideshow.
    You choke back a terrified scream.
   Your hand is clutching the tail of a giant lizard with the face of a boy!
You’re touching one of the sideshow freaks!
    You drop the tail in disgust.
    “I see you’ve met the Lizard Boy!” Mistress Barbarous chuckles. “I’m
sure you two will become good friends!”
    The crazy thing is: He looks sort of familiar.
    The whole tent is filled with freaky kids!
    There’s a girl with five tongues. She can’t even close her mouth! The five
tongues flop out onto her chin. It’s so gross!
   Next to her is a dog girl. She has the body of a girl but the head of a dog!
And instead of fingers she has paws!
    “Run!” the Lizard Boy warns you. “Run — or she’ll turn you into a freak,
just like us!”
    “Shut up!” Barbarous shouts at the Lizard Boy. “Shut up or I’ll make you
into a pair of lizard-skin boots!”
