    “Take the cuffs off the kid,” Mistress Barbarous commands the clown. “I
can handle this.”
   “Don’t try anything funny,” the clown policeman warns you. He unlocks
your handcuffs. “That’s my job! Ha-ha-ha!”
   He somersaults away, laughing at his own joke.
   Mistress Barbarous grabs your arm. She has an amazing grip. She
squeezes so hard, her hand almost bruises you.
    “Come on, circus kid,” she snaps. “You’re way too much trouble. I’m
putting you in the sideshow right now!”
   You gulp. Can she really do what you saw on the poster? you wonder.
   Can she put you in a jar?
   The jar is waiting for you on PAGE 99. Get going!
