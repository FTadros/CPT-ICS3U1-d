    You decide to sneak past Mistress Barbarous at the exit. It seems like the
best chance you’ll get to escape!
   “I’m getting out of here,” you whisper up to Richie.
    You slink along the shadows at the edge of the tent. You hide behind
poles. You duck under the seats.
   Mistress Barbarous is talking with one of the circus performers. She’s
showing him some sort of large poster that she holds in her hands.
   Here’s my chance, you think. If they stay busy, maybe I can sneak past
them. Just slip out, behind Mistress Barbarous’s back….
     As you approach, Mistress Barbarous unrolls the poster and holds it up in
full view.
   You want to scream when you glimpse what’s on it.
   Check out the poster on PAGE 49.
