   You’re one of the fastest kids you know. You’re fast, real fast.
   “Later, guys!” you cry. “I’ll try to come back for you!”
   You glance over at Mr. Peepers.
    “That way!” he instructs you, pointing to the other end of the sideshow
tent.
   You take off like lightning. But as you burst through the tent flaps into the
sunshine, you hear a man’s voice behind you. Calling.
    “Hey, kid! Wait up! That was amazing! I clocked you at two-point-three
seconds for that sprint! A world record!”
   The voice sounds friendly.
   “Come back!” he calls. “I can make you a star!”
   Hmmm …
   If you go back to the sideshow, turn to PAGE 10.
   If you keep running, turn to PAGE 37.
