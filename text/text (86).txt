    Mistress Barbarous laughs an evil laugh.
    “Please change my hands back!” you beg her. “Please!”
    “Hey! I want my cotton candy!” Mr. Peepers demands. He jumps up and
takes a huge chomp out of your left pinky.
    Instantly, the cotton candy grows back. It’s magic!
    A moment later, Richie walks in. His face is miserable. And he’s hiding
his own hands behind his back.
    “What happened to you?” you ask him with a gulp.
    He pulls his hands out to show you. He’s got five sticks of butter instead
of fingers!
    “Butterfingers,” he says glumly. “For the popcorn machine.”
   “You two will work here, in the food tent,” Mistress Barbarous decides.
“You’ll be our special attractions to get kids to buy more candy and popcorn.
What a brilliant idea!”
    You’ll never be able to leave the circus now. But at least you’ll get free
cotton candy for the rest of your life!
                                   THE END
