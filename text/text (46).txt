    Mistress Barbarous grabs your arm. Hard. And marches you back into the
tent.
   You don’t put up a fight. After all, what choice do you have? Your mom is
gone. And she’s not coming back for a week.
    Inside the tent, the knife thrower is still racing around and around the
ring. He looks impatient.
   “What’s going on? Is everything okay?” Richie asks you as Mistress
Barbarous leads you past him and into the ring.
    “Everything is just great! Sit back down!” Mistress Barbarous snaps at
Richie. “Your friend is about to become a real circus star. Do your stuff,
circus kid,” she adds to you. She pushes you toward the white target board.
    “Good luck!” she spits. “You’ll need it! Morton’s not very good!”
    Not very good? You gulp as you hurry to take your place.
    Not very good!
