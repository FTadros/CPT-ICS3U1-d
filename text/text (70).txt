   Wild, loud circus music starts to play.
   Spotlights sweep across the circus rings. You’re afraid to move a muscle.
   Then the clown car speeds into the center ring, almost running you down.
     Your heart starts hammering when you see the first clown step out of the
car. It’s the clown who can stretch his body!
   His name is written on his shirt: GEYORG THE CLOWN.
    Geyorg stretches his arms out long, grabbing you by the shoulders. Then
he stretches his legs!
   Up, up he goes. Lifting you up with him.
   A moment later, he’s fifteen feet tall. And you’re dangling in midair!
   “Don’t drop me!” you plead with him.
   “Ha-ha-ha!” he roars with laughter.
   You cling to his costume so you won’t fall.
   Hold on tight until you reach PAGE 96.
