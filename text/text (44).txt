   “All right, all right,” Mr. Peepers grumbles. “I’ll go and get your bag. You
wait here!”
    You cower behind the leather trunk, hoping that no one finds you. Sweat
trickles down the back of your neck.
    I’ll get my backpack, find Richie, and get out of this madhouse, you
think.
    Suddenly you hear the pitter-patter of little feet. It’s Mr. Peepers. He
clutches your backpack in his tiny hands.
    “Here! I found it!” he announces. “Now it’s chocolate time!”
   You unzip the pack and give Mr. Peepers all three candy bars. He earned
them.
   “Mmmm, goody, goody!” he chuckles. He unwraps one, stuffs it into his
mouth whole, and grins.
    “I have to go find my friend Richie,” you declare. You pull your pack
onto your shoulders. “But before I go, can you please tell me what is going on
here? Why is everyone out to get us?”
    Mr. Peepers shakes his head sadly.
