    You find the camera in your backpack and whip it out. You aim it right at
the evil lion tamer’s face.
   FLASH!
   A bright flare of light pops in Bostini’s eyes.
    “Aaaahhhh!” he cries, roaring even more loudly. But for an instant he lets
go of you.
   It’s just long enough for you to get away.
   “Run!” the Lizard Boy shouts, urging you on.
   You dash out of the Lizard Boy’s cage and race toward the sideshow exit.
   Behind you, though, you hear the Great Bostini calling.
   “Wait! I’ll help you escape if you let me see the picture. I’ve always
wanted a good picture of myself.”
    Hmmm. With Bostini on your side, your chances of escaping from the
circus are much better.
   But what if he’s lying to you? After all, he just tried to eat you!
   To wait and show the picture to Bostini, turn to PAGE 14.
   To keep on running, turn to PAGE 30.
