    Your heart pounds with nervous excitement as you and Ramon race
through the circus toward the sideshow.
    “Keep your eyes open,” you tell him. “If you see Bostini or one of the
others, let me know.”
   With Ramon standing guard, you slip into the sideshow. You grasp the
mirror tightly in one hand, the pendant in the other.
   “You’re back!” the Lizard Boy cries happily. Then he spots the pendant.
“Oh, no! Keep that thing away from us! It’s evil.”
   “No, it’s not,” you assure him. “It can do good, too! Watch.”
   You position the pendant so that the face is reflected in your mirror. Then
you stare at the reflection.
   ZAPPP! The purple energy bolt zips to your eyes.
   “Danny Mendleson, be yourself again,” you command, staring at the
Lizard Boy.
   BZZZT! In a flash, the Lizard Boy changes back into a normal kid. The
same kid you met a year ago at camp.
   “Thanks!” Danny yells, jumping up and down with joy.
   “Don’t thank me yet,” you answer. “We’ve got a ways to go.”
