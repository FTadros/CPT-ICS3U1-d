    SWOOSH! The man on the horse gallops right by you — so fast and
close, he nearly knocks you down.
    “You!” Mistress Barbarous cries. She points at you as she strides into the
middle of the ring. “Move it! Get over there so Morton the Knife Thrower can
practice!”
    She points at a huge white board. It’s a target with an outline of a person
painted on it.
    You know from circus camp what to do. You’re supposed to stand in front
of the board with your arms out like the painted outline. Then the knife
thrower will throw knives at you.
    Missing you. You hope!
   You glance at the man on the horse. And at his sharp, sparkling knife.
This could be really dangerous, you realize.
    Maybe you could still catch up with your mom outside. Then again, if you
defy Mistress Barbarous’s orders, there’s no telling what might happen….
    Well?
    If you stand in front of the board, input 1 (33)
    If you run to catch up with your mom, input 2 (9)
