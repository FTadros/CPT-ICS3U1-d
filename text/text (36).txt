   “But there’s no one here!” you protest. “I don’t know how to make cotton
candy!”
   “Figure it out!” Mr. Peepers screams, jumping up and down. “Make it for
me now, or I’ll tell the big, mean clown where you are!”
   “Okay, okay,” you say quickly. Man, what a whiner!
   You flip on the cotton candy machine. You’ve watched people make it, so
you sort of know what to do. You pour a packet of pink sugar into the bowl.
   “Hurry!” the clown screams. “Yummy, yummy, yum-yum-yum!”
   The fuzzy pink candy starts to build up on the sides of the metal bowl.
You need a paper cone to twirl it up. But you can’t find one.
    “Do you see any of those paper cones?” you ask the tiny clown as you
search.
   “Never mind that!” he snaps. “Just use your hands!”
   Your hands? That kind of sounds like fun!
   But the sugar is spinning pretty fast.
   Is it really a good idea?
