    The knife thrower finally realizes that he can’t reach you by throwing his
knives up in the air.
   But there is something else he can do with them.
   What is he doing? you wonder as he spins on his heel. He aims his knives
toward the corner of the tent.
   Right at the place where all the ropes are tied and staked to the ground.
   He aims at one rope in particular. The rope that holds all the trapeze
equipment in the air …
   The one holding you in the air!
   THWAP!
   “Aaaaagh!” you shriek as you plummet to the ground.
   Talk about cutting short your circus career!
                                  THE END
