   The bold black headline across the top of the poster reads: SEE IT TODAY!
THE NEWEST ADDITION TO THE SIDESHOW: THE KID WHO LIVES IN A JAR!

   And underneath is a picture of you! Trapped in a jar of slimy, oozy liquid!
    Your heart pounds. If you don’t get out of here, Mistress Barbarous is
going to seal you in a jar!
   Mistress Barbarous starts to roll up the poster. She’s going to see you!
    You crouch down and lift the bottom of the tent. Maybe you can squeeze
out under the side.
   You flop down onto your stomach. You squeeze under the canvas,
crawling out of the tent to freedom.
   You stand up to brush yourself off outside. Free!
   “Where do you think you’re going?” a stern voice behind you demands.
   Are you really free? Find out on PAGE 89.
