   “Here, take it. Take my camera!” you offer, desperate to escape.
   Mistress Barbarous eyes the camera hanging around your neck.
   “Okay, I will!” she exclaims. She drops you and grabs it.
   “Say cheese,” she sings, pointing the camera at the Lizard Boy. “No, wait.
Say moldy cheese! Because that’s what your scaly skin looks like! Ha-ha!”
   Then she pushes the button.
   Nothing happens.
   Uh-oh. The battery must be dead!
    “This is a piece of junk!” Barbarous growls, tossing the camera to the
floor.
   CRASH!
   Well, if it wasn’t junk before, it is now!
   “Get in the jar!” she roars at you.
   “No! Wait!” you plead. “Don’t make me get in there. I’ll do anything you
want! Anything!”
   “Anything?” Barbarous repeats with a twisted smile.
