    “Aaahhh!” you cry. You kick frantically, trying to find another rung to
stand on. You hold on with your hands for dear life.
    “Good luck with your new friend, Sara!” Susan cries. She jumps off the
ladder and hooks a trapeze. She lets out an evil chuckle as she sails away.
   “Hold on,” Sara cries. “I’ll try to help you.”
    “Oh, no, you won’t!” Susan screams. She flies over and the two of them
start fighting above you on the ladder!
    It trembles and shakes. Great! Just what you need! Now it’s even harder
to hold on!
   Uh-oh. What’s that tickling feeling?
    Your pet snake chooses that moment to slither out of your pocket and
slide up your arm. Up toward your armpit!
   This is not a good time to be tickled.
   “A snake? Ooohh! I love snakes!” Susan cries from above.
   “Oh, no!” Sara’s sweet voice cries down to you. “Look out!”
   Hold on for one more minute, while you turn to PAGE 90.
