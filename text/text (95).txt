    “Forget it,” you tell the pudgy clown. “I’m not putting my hands in there.
It might hurt!”
   “But I want cotton candy!” Mr. Peepers screams. “Cheater! Cheater!
Cheater!”
    Wow, you think. This guy acts as if he’s already had enough sugar for one
day.
    But you promised. So you’ve got to keep your word.
   Quickly you glance around the tent. You spot some pinwheels. You grab
one, rip the top off, and use the stick to catch the airy spun sugar in the cotton
candy machine. When you’ve scooped up a big wad of it, you hand it to the
clown.
    “Yummy! Thank you!” Mr. Peepers coos.
    “Okay, whatever,” you mutter.
    You scratch your head. Now what?
     You have two things to do — find Richie and escape from the circus. But
first, you want to go and pick up your backpack. You left it in the main tent
under the big top.
    You just pray that the knife thrower isn’t still waiting in there!
    Hurry to the big tent on PAGE 56.
