    You tear through the opening at the end of the sideshow tent. To the
outdoors.
   Yes! You’re free!
   But you stink worse than a dead skunk. It’s from the slime covering you.
   Outside, you spot a large, fenced-in area where a man with a huge hose is
washing the elephants.
   Do you think you have time to stop and get the slime washed off? You
smell so bad it’s making you dizzy!
    Or do you just want to keep going — until you’re far away from this
circus of doom?
   If you ask the man to hose you off, turn to PAGE 127.
   If you keep running, turn to PAGE 118.
