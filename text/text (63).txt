    You turn to race toward the exit. You’ve got to get out of the way before
the slime guy drops down!
   But you freeze in your tracks.
    Mistress Barbarous is standing by the exit. She’s talking to one of the
circus performers. Probably telling him to be on the lookout for you!
   If she spots you, you’re dead.
   “Pssst!” From above, you hear the guy on the perch.
   “It’s me, Richie!” he calls down in a loud whisper. “Come hide with me!”
    You see a ladder leading up to the platform. You could climb it and hide
with your friend.
    But maybe you should just make a run for it. You don’t want to be in this
creepy circus for one minute longer!
   Make up your mind — before Mistress Barbarous sees you!
