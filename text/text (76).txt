    Janos backs fearfully away from the pendant.
    “Go,” Mistress Barbarous commands. “This is none of your business.”
    “Okay,” Janos agrees, giving a little nod in your direction. “What’s your
rush? I’m going. I’m going.”
     Suddenly you realize something. He’s trying to give you a signal. Trying
to tell you that now is your chance to escape!
    Barbarous’s back is turned. She’s watching Janos. He’s leaving very
slowly.
    He backs out of the sideshow. One slow step at a time …
    Thanks, Janos! you think as you climb out of the jar.
   While Barbarous is still watching him leave, you run out the other way.
You’re covered in the disgusting glop, but you don’t stop to try to wipe it off.
    You race as fast as you can!
    Run to freedom on PAGE 55.
