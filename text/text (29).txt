   You whirl away, dancing faster and faster to escape the knife-tipped bow.
   “What an act!” Mistress Barbarous cries. “I’m a genius!”
    The good news is: You don’t get stabbed by Ramon’s deadly bow. You
learn how to dance around it!
   The bad news is: You have to dance around it every single night!
   You and Ramon are the new stars of the circus. Your act is called “Ramon
and the Dance-Crazy Kid.”
    While he plays, you dance wildly around the circus rings. You whirl and
twirl, your feet flying up in a pattern of crazy rhythms. The audience cheers,
especially when you take your bow at the end of the big show, and you’re still
dancing!
    What they don’t know is that you’re always dancing! The magic of the
charm never wears off. You dance day and night … week after week … year
after year …
   You’re a regular dancing fool!
                                 THE END
