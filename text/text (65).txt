   You think quickly about the stuff you brought to the circus.
   None of it seems like something this crazed ringmistress would want.
You’re not going to be able to make a deal with her.
   There’s only one thing you can think of to do: Scream your head off!
   “Help me!” you scream. “Somebody come quick!”
    A second later, a bulky, muscular man with a huge mustache rushes into
the sideshow.
   “What’s going on?” he asks, scowling at Mistress Barbarous.
   The sound of his voice makes her jump. And she drops you into the jar!
   It’s awful. The stinky goop covers your whole body. Ugh!
    “Nothing, Janos,” Mistress Barbarous snaps. “I just hired a new person
for the sideshow, that’s all.”
    “No, she didn’t!” you shout from the jar. “She didn’t hire me! She
kidnapped me! I want out of here!”
   “Barbarous, are you up to your old tricks?” Janos demands.
   “Back off!” Mistress Barbarous snarls. She pulls out a carved jade
pendant on a cord from inside her blouse.
   “No!” Janos cries. “Please, not the pendant!”
