   Way to go! You brought your lucky baseball cap with you!
   And you wore it for the big performance.
    The lion falling on you didn’t hurt a bit! And it turns out he doesn’t want
to eat you after all — he just ran over you by accident. He couldn’t stop fast
enough.
   You gently push the lion off you and spring to your feet.
   The audience roars with applause.
   You’re a huge hit! The crowd can’t get enough of you.
   You feel so lucky that you decide to walk the tightrope, even though you
never practiced it.
   “But there’s no net!” Pietro objects. “Don’t be foolish!”
   “I’m incredibly lucky!” you boast. “Stand back!”
   The crowd goes wild.
   You’ve only got one problem. You’ve turned to a very unlucky page.
Check it out. The page number is 13.
   You lose your balance on the wire and fall to the floor. Oooh, too bad.
Your hopes for a circus career have just been dashed to the ground!
                                  THE END
