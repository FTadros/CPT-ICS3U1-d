   “What are you doing up there?” you call softly. “And how come you
dropped slime on my head?”
   “My mouth was open. I drooled by accident,” Richie whispers. “Hurry!
Climb the ladder. No one will find us up here.”
   You start climbing. Whoops! It’s too late for you to take this advice:
   Never hide anywhere with someone who drools. Because you know
what? If Richie drools, it won’t be long till he also starts hiccuping or
burping.
   Which is exactly what he does, the minute you get up there.
   “Brrrruuuup! Oh, excuse me,” Richie mutters.
   “Aha!” Mistress Barbarous calls when she hears him belch. “Caught
you!”
    She pulls out an ancient pendant from around her neck and a mirror from
her pocket. She uses these two items to work a terrible spell. Within seconds,
she has transformed the two of you into conjoined twins. Joined at the
stomach!
    That’s right. You now share a tummy with Richie Fieldston. Which means
that when he burps, you burp! You two are a big hit in the sideshow. People
love to bring you things to eat.
   “Please, Richie,” you beg him every day. “No beans!”
                                  THE END
