   “Ssshhhh! Stop screaming. It’s all right,” a voice murmurs in your ear.
   “Huh? What happened? Where am I?” you croak, opening your eyes.
   “You’re home in bed, of course,” your mom tells you. “But you’ve got to
wake up. It’s time to get ready for your week at the circus. Remember?”
   Oh, no, you think. This was all just a dream?
   You shudder.
    Man, oh, man. If that was just a dream, you can’t imagine how scary the
real thing will be!
   “I changed my mind. I think I’ll just stay home,” you tell your mom.
   And that’s exactly what you do in
                                THE END!
