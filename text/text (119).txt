   CRACK! You snap the whip at the lion.
   Hold on! Wait just a second!
   You think a lion is more dangerous than the ringmistress?
   No, no, no!
    You obviously haven’t spent enough time around her, or you’d know
better.
   Remember when Mistress Barbarous called you “lunch”?
    Well, she wasn’t talking about what the lions were going to eat. She was
talking about her own idea of a tasty meal!
   Sorry! You almost reached a good ending in this book. But almost isn’t
good enough. So stop reading.
   Why don’t you go and make yourself a little snack?
   After all, that’s what Mistress Barbarous is doing!
                                  THE END
