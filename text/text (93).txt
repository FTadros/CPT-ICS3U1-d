   You brought a mirror along with you. And suddenly you have a plan.
   Quickly, you pull the mirror out of your pocket and flash it at Mistress
Barbarous.
   “A mirror?” you shout, taunting her. “You want a mirror? Well, I have
one! Come and get it.”
   Her eyes gleam when she sees it. She seems desperate.
     “Hey!” she shouts, turning her horse toward you. “Give that to me, you
little brat! I need it now!”
   “No way!” you cry, backing away.
   Barbarous gallops straight toward you. She leans down, trying to grab the
mirror out of your hands. The magic pendant dangles from her fist.
   You let Barbarous get close. Very close.
   Then you snatch the pendant from her fist.
   WHACK! It swings into the mirror — and the mirror shatters.
   “No!” Barbarous cries. “What have you done? Noooooooo!”
