  The woman in the pink leotard swings toward you. “I’m Susan the
Human Snake,” she calls in a sweet voice.
   When she comes within a few feet of you, she reaches out.
   Thank goodness, you think. She’s going to help you!
   Help you get away from the clown …
    You start to take her hand. But as you lean out, she grabs your ankles
instead!
    An instant later, she lets her whole body drop so that she’s hanging on to
the bottom of your legs. Her weight drags at you.
   You were having trouble holding on to Geyorg before.
   Now you’re doomed!
   “Ahhh!” you cry. “Get off me!”
   You try to kick her loose. But she holds on tight, laughing.
   Your hands ache from clutching the clown’s costume so tightly. What are
you going to do?
   Then you remember: You brought some stuff from home.
   But will any of it help you now?
   If you brought the ball of twine, turn to PAGE 41.
   If you don’t have the twine, turn to PAGE 122.
