   A rope ladder! you finally decide. I’ll make a rope ladder.
    But while you were making up your mind, Geyorg the clown was busy,
too. He’s stretched his fingers like pretzels. They’re bending around
backwards — reaching for the ball of twine.
   Before you can even start on your rope ladder, Geyorg snatches the twine
from your grasp!
   Oops.
   The chance of surviving this adventure just slipped from your grasp as
well!
                                 THE END
