   You freeze. Panicked.
   You’ve just stepped on someone. But who?
   “Get off my foot!” the voice in the clown car says.
   Hey! You recognize that voice.
   “Richie?” you ask.
   “Yeah!” he cries. “I’m so glad you found me! I was just hiding here,
hoping you would come!”
   “Excellent!” you exclaim. “Let’s get out of here!”
     You reach for the handle. But before Richie can answer you, the car door
flies open, and a clown climbs in.
   Then another clown.
   And another, and another, and another …
    “Ouch!” Richie screams as you and he are squashed against the back of
the car.
   “Hey, get out!” you cry. “There’s not enough room!”
   But the clowns don’t listen to you. They keep coming and coming and
coming.
   They call clown makeup “pancake makeup.”
   Now you know why — you’re squashed as flat as a pancake, and you
wish you could make up another ending to this story!
                                 THE END
