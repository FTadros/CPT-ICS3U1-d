   The Great Bostini’s horrible lion teeth snap in the air, inches from your
nose.
   “Ahhhh!” you scream.
     Panic fills you. You kick at Bostini. He’s enormous — nearly seven feet
tall! His long black hair is greased back.
   Bostini roars again, baring his deadly teeth.
   It’s terrifying!
   You have to do something!
   Desperately, you reach into your backpack. Do you have anything that
might work to fight the lion tamer?
   What do you have with you?
    If you have a camera, maybe the flash will blind him. Take Bostini’s
picture on PAGE 100.
   If you have talcum powder, throw it in his face on PAGE 25.
   If you don’t have either of these, turn to PAGE 119.
