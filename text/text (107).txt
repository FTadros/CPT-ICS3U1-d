    You plunge to the ground, screaming your head off.
   But as you fall, your old friend Mr. Peepers comes to the rescue! He
shoves a big trampoline under you.
    BOING! You bounce. You’re breathless and shaken, but okay.
    “Listen up, kid.” Mr. Peepers lectures you as you climb off the
trampoline. “Never bring a snake to the circus. They’ll get you into a lot of
trouble.”
   He’s right. You’ll never survive the circus if all you’ve got is chocolate, a
camera, and a snake.
   But since you made it this far, you get a break. Go back to PAGE 2 and
choose again.
    The chocolate bars are good. And the camera is okay. But pick something
besides Peppy, your pet snake!
    Choose something other than the snake. Go back to PAGE 2.
