   “Wait!” Bostini calls. “The photo! I want to see it!”
    “No way!” you shout. It would be too risky to trust him. You’ve got to
find Richie and get out of here.
    The last time you saw Richie, a clown had him pinned to the ground with
a giant shoe. That was in the backstage tent. So that’s where you go!
    Crowds of circus people mill around in the backstage tent. They’re
dressed in their costumes, drinking coffee and reading the newspaper. A few
of them glance at you, then look away in boredom.
   Richie is nowhere to be seen.
   Hmmm, you think. I need help to find Richie and get out of here. Maybe
one of these circus people can be trusted.
   But which one?
   Try to find someone nice on PAGE 42.
