    “I can’t believe it!” you gasp. You stare at the decrepit clown skeleton in
horror.
   As the last traces of the magic wear off, Geyorg’s bones disconnect from
each other and crumble to the ground.
    “What is going on here?” Richie moans again.
    In answer, Mr. Peepers the clown races up and hugs your legs.
    “You did it! You took Barbarous’s powers away!” he shouts. “Now none
of them will ever be human again!”
    “Yes!” you and Richie cheer. You high-five each other.
    “Wow,” Richie says. “Now let’s get out of here!”
  “Not yet,” you tell him. “We’ve got to free the kids in the sideshow first.
Come on.”
    You race to the clown tent and find a hand mirror. Then you take it and
the pendant to the sideshow tent.
   With Mr. Peepers telling you what to do, you stare at the reflection of the
pendant in the mirror.
   ZZZAAPPP! A purple beam of energy bolts into your eyes and lights up
your face.
    Using the powers of the pendant, you change all the sideshow kids back
into normal human beings.
    Celebrate on PAGE 18.
