  “Thanks a lot,” you tell Sara. “But I’m looking for my friend right now.
Maybe later.”
    “Yeah, whatever,” she says. As she turns away, you glimpse something
flickering out of the corner of her mouth.
    It looks like a forked tongue!
    You probably just made a very good choice!
    You hurry on through the crowds of circus people. Leaving the backstage
tent, you find yourself in the clowns’ dressing room. It’s strangely quiet as
you step inside.
    “Richie?” you call out softly. No answer.
    There are no clowns in sight. The little clown car sits empty off to the
side. Dressing tables with mirrors and lights line the sides of the tent. This is
where the clowns put on their makeup.
    Richie’s not in here, you think. Where should I look now?
    You’re trying to decide when you hear a voice over the microphone
system. It’s Mistress Barbarous!
   “Attention, staff,” she says. “Our two young visitors are lost. Keep your
eyes open. Bring them to me if you spot them!”
    Your throat tightens up when you hear that. Now everyone in the whole
circus will be looking for you!
