   “Welcome!” a voice booms at you over a microphone. “Welcome to the
most astounding show on Earth!”
   You step into a dimly lit circus tent. Rope shadows dance on the pointed
canvas tops. The smell of animals fills your nose.
    “Good-bye, honey,” your mom calls from the entryway. She blows you a
kiss. “Have fun.”
    “Okay, Mom … bye,” you mumble. You’re distracted by how spooky the
circus tent looks. So gloomy. So creepy.
   “How come it’s so dark in here?” Richie Fieldston whispers at your side.
He brushes his red hair out of his eyes.
   “I don’t know,” you answer. “And where is everyone?”
   You and Richie were in circus camp together this summer. You learned
how to fly on the trapeze, do clown acts, and ride bareback on a horse.
    You were both so good at it, you won the chance to spend a whole week
in a real circus.
   “What are you two waiting for?” a female voice commands over the
microphone. “Come on down, you lucky kids. And make it fast!”
   You squint into the darkness. The voice sounds familiar.
   “Mistress Barbara?” you call. “Is that you?”
   “The name’s not Barbara,” the voice snaps. “It’s Barbarous!”
