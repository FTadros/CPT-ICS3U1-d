    “Let me go!” you manage to croak, even though the evil clown’s hands
are clamped around your throat.
    “Psst,” a voice near you says. You feel a tug on your sleeve.
    You glance down. A cute little clown in a frilly pink suit is trying to get
your attention. His cheeks are round and rosy. Blue glitter stars are painted
around his eyes.
    The clown who’s choking you doesn’t notice the other clown.
   “Hi. I’m Mr. Peepers. Got anything to eat?” the pudgy little clown
whispers to you. “If you do, I’ll help you get free.”
    This little clown is my only hope! you realize.
    But did you bring any food with you on this adventure?
