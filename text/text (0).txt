            BEFORE YOU JOIN THE CIRCUS … READ THIS!
   Congratulations! After a week at circus camp, you and your friend Richie
have been selected to spend a week as guest performers in a real-life circus.
   But this is no ordinary three-ring adventure.
   This is a terrifying circus of doom!
   Only if you make the right choices will you and Richie survive your
bone-chilling experience under the big top.
    Since this is a special GIVE YOURSELF GOOSEBUMPS, you get to
take three things with you for extra help. Read through the list of objects on
the next two pages. Then decide what you think you will need.
   But remember, you may take only three things. No more!
   What will you need most when the going gets tough?
   It’s up to you to choose...
