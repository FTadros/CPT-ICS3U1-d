   You leap out of the way of the speeding clown car.
   The car screeches to a halt. The doors fly open, and circus clowns start
pouring out.
    A skinny clown with a rainbow wig pushes Richie facedown and puts a
giant clown shoe on his back.
   “Help me!” Richie shouts.
   You step over to try to help him, but you freeze in your tracks.
   A huge clown with a green face and a hideous, glaring smile is stalking
toward you. His teeth are horrible. They’re black.
    His arms are outstretched. Reaching for you. As if he wants to grab you
by the throat.
   He’s too far away to reach me, you think.
   But it doesn’t matter.
   Because his arms suddenly start to stretch and grow!
   The arms grow skinnier and skinnier as they lengthen.
   “Nooooo!” you scream.
   The long arms reach you!
   Then the clown’s white-gloved hands close around your throat.
   Finish screaming on PAGE 51.
