   No matter how hard you try, you can’t stop dancing.
   Stay calm, you try to tell yourself. That’s what you learned in circus
camp. And think! What can you do?
   If you have a mirror with you, maybe you can try to catch the reflection of
Barbarous’s pendant and aim it into your own eyes!
    But that might be dangerous. Who knows what will happen if you gaze at
the magic pendant?
    On the other hand, if you have the bullwhip, you might be able to whip
the violin out of the gypsy’s hands.
   If you have the mirror and you want to use it, input 1 (15).
   If you have the bullwhip and you want to use it, input 2 (29).
   If you don’t have either, or dont want to use them, input 3 (57).
