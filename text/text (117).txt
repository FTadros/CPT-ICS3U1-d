    You don’t have the camera. You don’t have the talcum powder. And the
rest of the stuff you brought seems useless. There’s nothing you can do except
scream your guts out.
   “Help!” you yell. You cower away from the lion tamer’s razor-sharp teeth.
    Too bad no one hears you. No one except Mr. Peepers. And Mr. Peepers
can’t stand the sight of violence, so he squeezes his eyes shut.
   And so should you. Because you definitely don’t want to see what
happens next. It’s too gory and disgusting for words!
    But have you ever watched those TV programs about wild animals eating
their prey?
   That should give you some idea of what happens to you in
                                 THE END.
