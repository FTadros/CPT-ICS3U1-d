   “Get into place!” Barbarous demands over the microphone.
   “Forget it!” you shout. “I’m out of here.”
   You spin around and race up the aisle. You wave to Richie as you zip past
him. I hope he leaves, too, you think.
   You run. Out of the creepy tent. Through the dust of the parking lot,
where your mom’s minivan is heading for the road.
   “Mom!” you shout, waving your arms frantically. “Wait! Come back!”
   Your mom has the window rolled up.
   Oh, no! She can’t hear me, you realize.
   But she glances over. She sees you waving and waves back.
    “Bye!” she mouths. She flashes you a big smile and then pulls out of the
parking lot.
   Why didn’t she stop? you wonder.
   You hear a nasty little laugh. Behind you. You whirl around.
   It’s Mistress Barbarous. Waving and smiling good-bye to your mom
behind your back.
   No wonder your mom left! She thought you and Barbarous were happily
waving good-bye.
   “Back inside!” Mistress Barbarous says through clenched teeth.
   Do what she says. Go back into the tent on PAGE 48.
