    The huge clown puts his hands up to cover the horror underneath.
    Under the makeup there’s no flesh. No skin. Just bones!
    Just a gruesome, worm-eaten skull.
    It’s horrifying! You’re frozen with fear.
    “Come on,” Mr. Peepers yells. “We’ve got to get away now! Once he puts
his face back on he’ll come after you again! Run!”
   The pudgy clown turns and bolts out of the tent. You run! Your heart
pounds like a bass drum.
     You follow Mr. Peepers to a smaller tent next to the big top. This tent is
filled with food machines: a hot dog cooker, nachos, popcorn, peanuts, a
cotton candy machine. But the tent is deserted.
    There’s no one to sell the food to you.
    “Cotton candy,” Mr. Peepers demands. He seemed so cute before. Now
he’s all red in the face. “I want cotton candy! Now!”
    Give him what he wants on PAGE 38.
