   Mistress Barbarous grabs you by both arms. You notice a thick rope coil
hanging from her belt. A lasso!
   “Hey, clown, I’m looking for two kids,” she snarls. “Have you seen
them?”
   Your heart pounds. You shake your head silently.
   But you shake it a little too hard. Your wig flies off!
   “Ha-ha-ha!” Mistress Barbarous howls with laughter. “You almost tricked
me, kid! Almost!” The last word becomes a growl.
   You try to break into a run, but the big clown shoes trip you! In a flash
Mistress Barbarous uncoils the lasso.
   Before you know it, you’re tied up like a calf at a rodeo!
