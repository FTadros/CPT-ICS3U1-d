   You decide to dress up as a clown. That way you can search for Richie
and not be noticed!
   You start by pulling on a crazy clown wig. Green.
   Your hands shake. Hurry! you urge yourself. You’ve got to finish before
anyone comes in.
   You sit at the makeup table to put on white clown-face paint. You add a
huge, frowning black mouth and blue triangles around your eyes.
   Within minutes, you don’t even recognize yourself!
   All you need now is a costume. A bunch of them are hanging on a rack
behind you.
   You pick a suit that’s half red and half green, split right down the middle.
The costume is big and floppy, much too big for you. But so what? Clowns
always wear baggy clothes, right?
   For a final touch, you pull on a pair of giant clown shoes.
   Perfect! you think, staring at yourself in the mirror. Now I can go
anywhere, and no one will know it’s me!
   Boldly, you walk right out into the middle of the big tent.
   And, BAM! Right into Mistress Barbarous!
   Hope your costume works on PAGE 115.
