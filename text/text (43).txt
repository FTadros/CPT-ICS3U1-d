   You have to stop Mistress Barbarous from getting another mirror!
   You stare down at your hand.
   Hey. I’ve got a whip! you realize. And the lions seem to be obeying your
commands. That gives you an idea….
   CRACK! You snap the whip in the air.
   “Hup! Lions!” you address the three killer animals. “Attack!”
   You point at Barbarous, who is racing away on her horse.
   “Attack! Attack!” you shout, cracking your whip and pointing at
Barbarous.
   The lions roar. They heard you! Excellent!
   The only thing is: Cats don’t understand pointing.
   When you command them to attack, they attack you!
   You know, it’s not polite to point.
   And in this case, it’s not safe, either!
                                   THE END
