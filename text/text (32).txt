    Mistress Barbarous’s eyes narrow as she lifts the cord that hangs around
her neck. Dangling from it is an ancient-looking jade pendant, carved with the
image of a face.
   “You’ll be sorry,” Mistress Barbarous repeats. She quickly pulls out a
small mirror. She dangles the pendant in front of it and gazes at the reflection.
   Your mouth falls open as you see a beam of purple light shoot from the
pendant face in the mirror to Mistress Barbarous’s eyes!
   Mistress Barbarous glances up at Ramon the Gypsy. Her eyes are pools of
glowing purple light. You swallow hard.
    “No!” Ramon cries as the purple energy bolt shoots from her eyes to his.
A second later, the gypsy begins to play his violin wildly. Faster and faster.
Like a train picking up speed.
    And the violin bow in his hands begins to grow.
    You can’t believe your eyes.
    The bow grows longer and longer.
    And a sharp blade shoots out of the tip!
