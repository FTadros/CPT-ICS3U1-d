   You throw yourself flat just in time.
   One instant later the lion sails toward you….
   But because you ducked, he flies over your head and lands on Morton the
Knife Thrower instead.
   “Nooooo!” Morton cries as the lion topples him.
   You stand up and dust yourself off.
   “Duck again!” the voice calls from above.
   You hit the ground. Then you roll over and peer into the dark area of
ropes and platforms at the top of the tent.
   It’s Richie! you think. This time you recognized his voice.
   He’s been hiding up there this whole time!
    A second lion leaps over you. But this time, the lion doesn’t even seem to
be aiming for you. He’s leaping at the Great Bostini, the lion tamer, who’s
been standing near the lion cages at the side of the ring.
   With a horrible growl, the lion rips Bostini’s costume to shreds.
   The lion is going crazy! Attacking his master!
   “Help me! Please!” Bostini begs you.
   Give him a hand on PAGE 126.
