   “Yes!” you gasp to the tiny clown at your side. “I have food. I’ve got a
bag of peanuts.”
  “Peanuts?” Mr. Peepers sputters. “Peanuts? Do I look like an elephant?
What would I want with a bag of peanuts?”
   “Give me a break!” you whisper with the last of your breath. “Please help
me!”
   “Don’t you have any chocolate bars?” the pudgy clown demands.
   Too bad you can’t answer him. You just gasped your last breath.
   Oh, well. Nice try.
    At least you’ve learned something for next time. And this is a rule that
will get you through all kinds of tricky situations, both in GOOSEBUMPS
and in real life:
   Chocolate can almost always save the day!
                                  THE END
