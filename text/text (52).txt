   “What is that smell?” a male voice booms.
   It’s definitely not Mistress Barbarous!
   But you could still be in trouble, you realize.
   The footsteps come closer. A big black boot tip pokes into the straw by
your face.
   “I smell fresh young meat!” the voice bellows.
   In the next instant, he pries away the straw you’re hiding under. He grabs
you by the shoulders.
   “No, Bostini!” Mr. Peepers’s voice shouts. “Leave the kid alone!”
   Bostini? The Great Bostini? He’s the lion tamer Mr. Peepers warned you
about. One of Mistress Barbarous’s dangerous relatives.
   Bostini opens his mouth wide. Incredibly wide!
   He growls at you. “Roooarrrr!”
   That’s when you notice his teeth.
   They’re pointed. Long. Razor sharp.
   They’re the teeth of a lion!
   “Aaaaaahhhhh!” you scream in terror.
