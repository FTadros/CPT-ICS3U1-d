   Mistress Barbarous drags you into a long, narrow tent.
   The sideshow.
   It’s dark. Spooky and completely dark.
    “Now, where are the lights in here?” Barbarous mumbles to herself. She
searches with her free hand for a light switch.
    Hey, you think. While she’s searching for the light switch, maybe I can
find something, too! Something that might help me get out of here. A
weapon!
   You wave your hands frantically in the dark.
   Your hand brushes against something scaly. You grab it.
    It feels like the tail of a lizard! Not much of a weapon — but maybe it’s
better than nothing. How desperate are you?
   “Where is that switch?” Barbarous growls furiously.
   You don’t have much time!
   Are you going to use the scaly thing as a weapon or not?
    If you’ve already been in the sideshow, you know what you’re
touching. Turn to PAGE 130.
