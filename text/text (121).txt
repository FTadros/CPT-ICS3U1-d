   Your stomach flips over as you stare open-mouthed at the sideshow
exhibits.
    The Lizard Boy …
    The Girl with Five Tongues …
    The Bearded Girl …
   And that smell! It’s coming from a cage that’s dark inside. You can’t
make out what’s in it, but a sign over the exhibit reads: SEE IT! SMELL IT! AND
FOR AN EXTRA $5 YOU CAN TASTE IT! THE KID WITH ROTTEN FLESH!

   Disgusting! Revolting! No way do you want to see it. The stench alone
makes you stagger and fall to your knees.
    Then you lock eyes with the Lizard Boy. The giant lizard is as big as you
are. His face looks almost human.
    Except that it’s covered in scales!
    Something in the Lizard Boy’s eyes looks familiar. Normal.
    Then, with a flash of dread, you recognize him. It’s Danny Mendleson! A
kid who was at circus camp with you last year! Last year he won the chance
to spend a week in this circus.
    “Be careful,” he whispers. “Don’t let Barbarous catch you, or you’ll end
up here forever. Like me!”
    Forever? Uh-oh! Find out what he means on PAGE 17.
