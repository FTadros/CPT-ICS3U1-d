   The twin sister trapeze artists transform into harmless little garden snakes.
   And Morton the Knife Thrower changes, too. Into a white miniature

   “Look at that!” Richie exclaims.
   You spin around and see Geyorg the Clown. He is slowly taking off his
clown suit.
   You gasp. Underneath, he’s not a human being at all!
   He’s a skeleton!
   Don’t scream until you read PAGE 110.
