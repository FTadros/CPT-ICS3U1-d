   You can feel your pet snake, Peppy, curled up in the pocket of your khaki
shorts. You love snakes. Sara the Human Snake gives you a good feeling.
Even though she does have a cobra on her costume.
   You decide to trust her.
   “Okay,” you tell Sara the Human Snake. “Let’s hit the ropes.”
   Sara leads you into the big top.
   “Follow me,” she instructs. “And hold on tight!”
    She begins to climb a rope ladder that hangs down from the highest point
on the roof.
   You follow and climb up the rope rungs. You feel the ladder sway as the
two of you climb.
   But then you feel something strange.
   TWANG! The rope jerks.
   Someone is following you up the ladder!
   Find out who it is on PAGE 27.
