   You glance at a woman in a pink leotard. She has a pink sequined snake
sewn on the front of her costume. She smiles at you. A good sign, you think.
   Then you take another look at the snake on her costume.
   It’s a cobra! Whoa!
    “Hi, I’m Sara the Human Snake,” she says sweetly. “You must be one of
our young guest performers. Would you like me to show you some cool tricks
on the trapeze?”
   “Um — sure,” you agree. “But can I ask you a few questions first?” In
your head, you add: Like, how do I get out of this horrible circus?
    “Oh, come on.” Sara giggles, taking your hand and leading you toward
the main tent. “Let’s have some fun on the ropes first. We can talk later!” She
grins at you playfully.
    Okay, you think. If I go and work out with her for a while, maybe she’ll
help me escape.
   Then again, maybe she’s leading you to Mistress Barbarous!
   Do you dare trust her?
   That depends. How much do you like snakes?
   If you brought your pet snake from home, you’ll probably trust her.
