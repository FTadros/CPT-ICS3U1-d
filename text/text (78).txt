   Mistress Barbarous takes a step closer to you.
    You want to dart away as fast as you can. Away from the dangerous
ringmistress.
   But which way? She’s blocking the exit.
    You have only two other choices. You see the flap that you and Mr.
Peepers raced through earlier. It leads into the big tent. Maybe the clowns will
be gone by now! And maybe you can find Richie. Then you two could escape
together.
  You also notice a sign pointing to another flap. It reads SIDESHOW.
Hmmm. There might be a way out through there.
   But the very idea of a sideshow makes your skin crawl. The freaky
exhibits would probably be extra-disgusting in a crazy circus like this one.
   “Now come over here!” Mistress Barbarous demands as she draws nearer.
   “Hurry,” Mr. Peepers squeals. “Which way are you going to run?”
   If you race into the sideshow, turn to PAGE 116.
    If you run into the big tent, say good-bye to Mr. Peepers now. Then race
to PAGE 56.
