    Dust flies up under your feet as you and Mr. Peepers run through the
circus tents.
   What about Richie? you think. He’s in trouble, too!
    “I have to go back for my friend!” you shout to Mr. Peepers. You turn to
go help Richie, but then you see the evil clown stretching his arms again. The
awful white hands are coming for you!
   “Never mind!” you scream. “Let’s go!”
    Mr. Peepers ducks under a lion cage. You follow. You both crawl on your
bellies to the other side. Then you hide behind a large leather trunk.
    You watch as the clown hands search everywhere for you. But they can’t
find your hiding place. Finally they give up and shrink away.
   “We did it!” you exclaim. “Thank you so much!”
    “You’re welcome. Now, where’s my chocolate?” Mr. Peepers holds out
his hand expectantly.
    “It’s in my backpack,” you answer, breathing hard. “I left it in the main
tent.”
   “All right, follow me,” Mr. Peepers orders you.
    “B-b-but Mistress Barbarous is in there!” you stammer. “She was trying
to kill me before!”
