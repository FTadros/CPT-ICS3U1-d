    You gaze down and see another young woman in a pink leotard. Except
she has a black snake sewn on her costume. Another cobra.
   Otherwise she looks exactly like Sara the Human Snake!
   Twins? Uh-oh. Doesn’t Mistress Barbarous have twin sisters?
   “Who’s that?” you call up to Sara.
   “Oh, no! That’s Susan, my sister,” Sara moans. “She gets really jealous
when I work out with anyone besides her.”
  “Hey, what are you doing, Sara?” Susan yells. She sounds really angry.
“Who’s your new friend?”
   “I’m just here for a week,” you say, trying to sound friendly.
   “Really?” she sneers. “Well, be careful, I’d hate for you to fall.” TWANG!
She shoves the ladder.
    You glare down at her. She has a cold glint in her eye — and a huge pair
of steel shears in her hands!
    “Climb faster, kid,” she shouts at you. “Or you won’t have anything to
climb on!”
   Then she scales the ladder as fast as lightning. She’s right under your
rung.
   “Leave my friend alone,” Sara cries.
   But it’s too late. Susan cuts the rung under your feet!
   Hold on tight until you reach PAGE 44.
