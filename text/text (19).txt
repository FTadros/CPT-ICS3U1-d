   “You just can’t stay away, can you?” Barbarous taunts, grinning at you.
You stare up at her in terror.
   Mistress Barbarous is so evil! What will she do to me now? you wonder.
Your teeth chatter from cold and fear.
    She drags you into the center ring under the big top and shoves you down
to the dirt. Then she quickly backs away, leaving you there.
   You struggle to your feet … and gasp.
   All around you, circus acts are going on! Deadly acts!
   The knife thrower on horseback rides around and around the center ring.
Aiming his knife at you.
    Above you on trapezes are two women in pink leotards. They look ready
to jump. Right on top of you!
   Three ferocious lions are wandering around loose. They roar and growl.
   “Welcome, circus kid!” Barbarous bellows over the microphone.
“Welcome to your first — and last — performance under the big top!”
   The show starts on PAGE 72.
