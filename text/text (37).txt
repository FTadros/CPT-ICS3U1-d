   “I want to hide!” you tell Danny the Lizard Boy. “But where?”
   “Come in here,” he whispers.
   Quickly you slip into the cage with the Lizard Boy.
   “Get down,” Danny commands. He points to the corner with his tail.
    You lie down on the cold cement floor near the Lizard Boy’s piles of
straw and food. Using his tail, Danny covers you with dusty straw. You try not
to sneeze.
   You keep very still as someone steps into the sideshow.
   The sound of heels clicking on the cement floor comes closer and closer.
   Is it Mistress Barbarous? You can’t tell.
   You hold your breath and pray that the straw will cover you enough to
keep you hidden….
   Hold very, very still on PAGE 54.
