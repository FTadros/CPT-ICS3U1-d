   Pietro laughs when he sees the horrified look on your face.
    “No, no.” He chuckles, shaking his head. “Don’t worry, it’s not
dangerous. Here’s what will happen: You’ll lead a parade of clowns,
unicyclists, and animals out into the ring.”
   “Okay,” you say cautiously. “Sounds easy so far.”
    “Good,” Pietro exclaims. “Then you’ll start to run. The clowns won’t be
able to keep up, so they’ll fall all over the place acting goofy.
    “Here’s the tricky part,” he continues. “The lions, tigers, and unicyclists
chase you. You’ll run faster and faster, looking over your shoulder like you’re
scared! Finally, you run away and head backstage. What do you think? Want
to be in the show?”
   “Yeah!” you exclaim. It sounds like fun!
   “But what about Mistress Barbarous?” you ask. “She’s been out to get me
ever since I got here!”
