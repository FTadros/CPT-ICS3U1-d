   Mistress Barbarous kneels beside you and stares into your eyes. Her
whole face lights up with a purplish glow.
   “So you want to be a clown?” she demands, glaring at you with purple
eyes. “Fine! A clown you will be. Forever!”
   You gasp as a purple lightning bolt shoots out of her eyes and streaks to
your face.
   Mistress Barbarous laughs. “Here, have a look,” she says, holding up a
small mirror for you to see.
   You gaze fearfully into the glass.
   The makeup looks different. More real. More permanent.
   It is permanent! The clown face will never come off!
    But now that Mistress Barbarous has worked her magic on you, she
leaves you alone. The rest of the week in the circus flies by. The shows are
great. Little kids laugh and point at your clown face. It’s a blast!
    It’s not such a blast when the week ends and you have to go home,
though. Little kids still laugh and point. Everyone does.
   But at least when the teacher calls you the class clown it’s not entirely
your fault!
                                  THE END
