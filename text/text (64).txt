   “AAAAAHH-CHOO!” the Great Bostini cries.
   His head snaps forward in a great convulsive sneeze. His mouth opens
wide enough for a television to fit inside.
   Then it chomps closed with a terrible snap.
    Unfortunately, it snaps shut … on you! His teeth close around your neck,
biting your head right off.
   He swallows your head in one gulp. But there’s one part he doesn’t like.
Your ears!
   He burps them up.
    “Perfect,” Mistress Barbarous coos as she enters the sideshow tent. She
uses her magic powers to stick the ears onto the sides of your neck. Now you
have no head, but you can hear everything just fine.
   “We have a new attraction for the sideshow,” Mistress Barbarous
announces. “The Eerie Ear-ie Kid!”
                                 THE END
