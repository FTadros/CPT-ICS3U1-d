       “Everybody needs a lucky baseball cap,” you tell Mistress Barbarous.
       “Okay, hand it over,” she demands. She plunks you down on the ground.
       You pull off your cap and place it gently in her hands.
       “Now can you please tell me the way out of this crazy place?” you beg
her.
       Mistress Barbarous pulls the cap onto her head.
       “You know, this hat does feel lucky!” she exclaims.
       “See? I told you!” you say. “Now, which way is the exit?”
   “I feel so lucky! I feel like the best ballplayer there ever was!” she shouts.
She looks so excited. Too excited!
       Mistress Barbarous picks you up and hurls you through the air.
       SPLAT! You land in the jar of smelly goop.
   “What a lucky throw!” Mistress Barbarous boasts. She strides over,
clamps the lid on the jar, and seals it closed.
       Lucky for her. Unlucky for you.
     You’re doomed to float in the disgusting gray goop for the rest of your
life.
       But look on the bright side — you’ll never run out of hair gel.
                                     THE END
