   “Now, get in your jar!” Mistress Barbarous growls at you. She pushes you
toward a four-foot-tall jar filled with oozing gray goop. It’s the same jar you
saw in the poster.
    “Don’t do it!” the Lizard Boy calls. “Whatever you do, don’t get into that
jar!”
    The Girl with Five Tongues shouts, “Run!”
    It comes out, “Run-run-run-run-run!”
    “She’s too strong!” you cry. “I can’t break away!”
   Even with you kicking at her, Mistress Barbarous is able to lift you up.
She starts to shove you into the huge jar.
   Your hand dips into the cold, sticky gel. It’s so disgusting you feel like
you might retch. Plus, it smells terrible. Worse than the smell of rotting flesh!
    “No!” the Lizard Boy cries. “Make a deal with her!”
    You have no idea what he’s talking about — but you would give anything
to stay out of the jar. So you call out.
   “I want to make a deal!” you shout, struggling to keep Barbarous from
pushing you into the stinky jar.
