   For an instant, your eyes burn fiercely.
   Mistake, you think. This was a horrible mistake.
   But then you feel a strange sensation of power. It shoots from your
eyeballs to your brain.
   I don’t want to dance anymore, you think.
   Instantly, your feet stop moving. Yes! It works!
   You feel so powerful! Suddenly you know that anything you want,
anything you think, will come true!
    “You don’t belong in a circus,” you shout at Mistress Barbarous. “You
belong in a zoo!”
    Without doing anything else, you simply stare at her and imagine her as
an ape.
   ZAPPPP!
    “Nooooo!” she cries as the purple beam hits her. In a split second, she is
transformed into a large, hairy gorilla.
   “Wow!” you exclaim, your mouth gaping open. “Cool!”
   You take the pendant from the ape’s hand. Then you turn your purple gaze
on Ramon. “Stop playing,” you command.
   Ramon drops his bow, exhausted.
   “What are you going to do with the pendant?” he asks nervously.
