    Something horrible is going to happen, you realize.
    But what?
    Mistress Barbarous reaches for the large green jade pendant she wears
around her neck. She lifts the pendant in one hand and takes out a small,
ancient-looking mirror with the other.
    A chill of dread creeps up your spine. That pendant is dangerous. You’re
sure of it!
    You raise your whip, ready to snap it and knock the pendant and mirror
out of Barbarous’s hands.
    But right then, one of the lions crouches, tail lashing. He’s about to spring
at you!
    Now you’ve got two targets! But which is more dangerous? The lion —
or Mistress Barbarous?
    You have one split second to decide!
    If you crack the whip at the lion, turn to PAGE 121.
    If you crack the whip at Mistress Barbarous, turn to PAGE 128.
