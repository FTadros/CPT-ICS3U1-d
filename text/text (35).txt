   A star? Forget it. You’ve heard enough lies from these circus people. You
want to go home!
     So you keep running. Straight across the parking lot. Down the road. Up a
hill. Down another road.
    It’s six long miles home, but you make it. Panting and out of breath, you
drag into your room, flop down on your bed, and fall into a deep sleep.
   You sleep for eight days straight! By the time you wake up, the circus has
moved on to another town.
    It’s too late to help any of the kids stuck in the sideshow! And too late to
help Richie.
    Sure, you escaped safely, but you left your friends behind.
   And you don’t think you’ll get to the good endings in this book if you
abandon your friends, do you?
    No way.
   So go back to the beginning and try again. Because one thing’s for sure.
This is not a happy
                                     END.
