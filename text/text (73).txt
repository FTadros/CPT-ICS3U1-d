   No way are you going to stick around and get stuck!
   “Yikes!” you cry as you leap away from the board.
    THWAP! The knife pierces the wooden target. Stabbing it right through
the heart!
   “Whoa!” Richie cries.
   What kind of circus is this? If you hadn’t moved you’d be dead!
   “Richie, let’s get out of here!” you yell. “Come on!”
   You and Richie race toward the closest exit. It’s a slit in the tent flaps.
     “Catch them!” Mistress Barbarous screams over the microphone. “Don’t
let them get away!”
   You and Richie dash out of the main tent and into a large backstage tent.
Costumes and pieces of circus equipment are scattered on the floor.
    “What’s going on?” Richie cries. He shoots you a terrified glance. “Are
they trying to kill us or what?”
   “I don’t know!” you yell. “But look out!”
   A clown car is barreling straight at you.
   Trying to run you down.
   “Jump!” you shout. “Out of the way!”
   Dodge the clown car on PAGE 94.
