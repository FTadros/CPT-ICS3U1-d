    Danny tells you the real, human names of the rest of the sideshow freaks,
and you use the pendant and mirror to change them back into kids. At last
there’s only one left.
  “What’s that kid’s name?” you ask Danny as you point at the Bucket of
Human Slobber.
    It’s a hideous-looking bucket of milky slime with two eyes floating on top
of the liquid. And red hair.
   “I don’t know,” Danny moans. “He just arrived today.”
   “Richie?” you cry, your eyes opening wide.
   In answer, the two floating eyeballs blink at you frantically.
   “Richie Fieldston, be yourself!” you command, using the pendant’s
power.
   In a flash, the Bucket of Human Slobber changes into the red-haired kid
you came to the circus with.
   “Yuck!” Richie says, shaking off the last drops of slobber.
   “Yeah!” all the other circus kids cry.
   “What now?” Merrill Thornbush, who used to be the Girl with Five
Tongues, asks you.
   “Now we do what we came here to do! We put on a show!” you
announce.
   Show time starts on PAGE 18.
