   The instant Mistress Barbarous shoots that strange purple glare at you,
you feel your body begin to change.
    Slowly, painfully, you double over. Then you double over again. And
again!
    “Noooo!” you scream when you realize what’s happening.
    You aren’t just going to be shot out of a cannon.
    You’re going to become a cannonball!
   Your whole body is rolling itself up! Before you know it, you are a ball-
shaped human being who can’t walk or talk.
    In fact, you can’t do anything except fly out of a cannon at thirty miles
per hour.
    But it’s better than life in a jar.
   Actually, flying through the air is fun! You like the applause from the
audience. On some nights you really enjoy yourself. You have a ball!
    In fact, you are a ball!
                                      THE END
