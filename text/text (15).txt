   “H-h-how did this happen to you?” you stammer.
    “It happened to all of us,” Danny says, nodding at the other sideshow
exhibits. “We came here as normal kids. But Barbarous trapped us and used
her magic on us. Now we’re freaks.”
    “And we’ll be here forever,” the Girl with Five Tongues moans. Her other
tongues repeat the last word, like an echo. “Forever-forever-forever-forever.”
   The eerie echo makes your skin crawl.
    “I’ve got to find Richie and get out of here!” you declare. “But how do I
do it?”
   “I don’t know,” Danny says. “We all tried to run away. To escape. But
Barbarous always caught us.”
   “Someone’s coming,” Mr. Peepers declares. He’s been keeping watch
while you talk to your friend. “Probably Mistress Barbarous!”
   “Quick! Hide!” Danny whispers.
   “No! Run!” Mr. Peepers instructs you.
   Hide or run? Hide or run? Quick, choose!
   If you’re a fast runner, dash to PAGE 62.
   If not, you’d better hide on PAGE 39.
