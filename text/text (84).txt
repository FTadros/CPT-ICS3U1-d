    The knife-tipped bow seems to have a mind of its own!
    It lunges and leaps for you while the gypsy plays the music. And Ramon
can’t stop playing!
    You dodge frantically out of the blade’s way. Mistress Barbarous stands
on the other side of the tent, still holding the pendant and the mirror. She taps
her foot to the music.
   “Dance, circus kid!” she commands. She shoots bolts from her purple
eyes at you.
    Instantly, you begin to dance. You can’t help it.
    A deadly, dangerous dance!
    Keep dancing on PAGE 98.
