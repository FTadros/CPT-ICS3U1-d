   That night, you’re the ringmaster of the new All-Star Kid Circus! You,
Richie, and all the other sideshow kids are the stars!
     Richie rides bareback on a horse. Danny Mendleson juggles five clubs of
fire. Merrill does an amazing trapeze act with the boy who used to be the Kid
with Rotten Flesh. Now he’s a normal kid named Elliot Glass.
    The other circus performers, the regular clowns, acrobats, and jugglers,
help out in the show. They’re delighted that the reign of Mistress Barbarous
and her evil relatives is over.
   “But what about the pendant?” Richie whispers to you near the end of the
show. “If it falls into the wrong hands —”
   “That will never happen!” you interrupt. “Just watch.”
   As a grand finale to the circus you clap your hands three times. Three
magnificent elephants parade into the ring.
   They put their front legs in the air and stand up.
    You race forward and position the pendant on the ground in front of the
biggest elephant. When she lowers her huge front feet, she crushes the jade to
smithereens.
    “Good night, everyone!” you address the crowd over the microphone.
“I’m proud to announce that this is a very happy
                                    END!”
