    Mistress Barbarous’s eyes are terrifying pools of glowing purple fire. She
glances at your cotton-candy wrapped hands and laughs.
   “Candy Hands!” she declares with delight.
   In the next instant, she shoots a bolt of purple light out of her eyes.
   As the bolt hits, you feel a strange charge of energy. A tremendous shock.
   Your try to wriggle your fingers. You can’t even feel them!
   You stare down at your hands.
   Instead of fingers, five tufts of cotton candy spring from each palm.
   Horror fills you.
   “Nooooooo!” you cry.
   Your hands are pretty sticky, but turn to PAGE 88 anyway.
