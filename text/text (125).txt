the hose.
   He nods and aims the hose at you.
     Whoa! The strong blast of water knocks you down. You manage to stand
up again, but the blasting stream pushes you backwards. Back toward the big

    “Stop!” you shout, waving your arms and trying to signal to the man to
stop squirting you.
   But he just laughs and turns up the water pressure.
   You stumble backwards.
   Back into the circus tent.
   And into Mistress Barbarous’s waiting arms!
