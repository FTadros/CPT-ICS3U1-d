   You don’t have the twine.
   Oh, well. It doesn’t matter that much anyway.
   Because a minute later, you lose your grip.
   Susan flies through the air and grabs on to a trapeze.
   You reach out for one, desperately. But you miss.
   You begin to tumble forward, then fall.
   But you’re a circus performer! So you don’t just fall flat on your face.
   No way.
    You twist in the air, then do two-and-a-half backwards flips and a triple
pike.
   Then you fall flat on your face.
   Needless to say, you won’t be performing that trick again!
                                  THE END
