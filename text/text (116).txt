    You keep running. Who cares how bad you smell? You just want to get as
far away from the circus as you can!
   Feet pounding, you race toward the road. A few cars drive by, but none of
them stop when you wave to them. In fact, the drivers hold their noses. You
must really smell awful.
    Finally you come to a gas station. You call your mom and beg her to come
get you immediately.
   When she picks you up, all she can say is, “Honey, you smell awful!”
   And the stink never fades. No matter how hard you scrub!
    At school, your teacher holds her nose every time you walk into the
classroom. Your friends won’t eat lunch with you. Even your parents ask you
to stay in your room with the door shut.
    One year later, the circus comes back to town. Sadly, you make the
decision to return.
    “Hi! We knew you’d be back,” the Lizard Boy says. He and all the other
freaks are happy to see you.
   You climb into your jar and pull the lid closed.
   The sideshow is the only place you belong now.
   Yes, this ending stinks, but hey! So do you!
                                 THE END
