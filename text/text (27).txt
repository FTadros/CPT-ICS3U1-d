   As you dance, you pull the bullwhip out of your backpack. With a snap of
your wrist, you crack the leather whip in the gypsy’s direction.
    Too bad! Not only does the whip not hit the violin, but it curls around in
the air and lashes back at you!
   The whip wraps itself around your body!
   “Noooo!” you cry as you fall to the floor. You can’t move a muscle! The
whip is wrapped around your body like a cobra!
   Mistress Barbarous roars with laughter. She draws nearer.
   Quick! What else did you bring with you?
   Nothing.
   You wouldn’t be on this page unless you had the chocolate bars, the
camera, and the bullwhip.
   You know the rules. You were only allowed to bring three things. Face it!
You’ve run out of props.
   You’re whipped!
                                  THE END
