Choose any three things from the list below. Then pack your bags and
head for the circus! 
   1. CAMERA: Great for taking pictures of the other circus performers you
      meet. Also useful for recording proof of evildoing (if by some strange chance
      you run into any trouble during this adventure).
   2. DICTIONARY OF CIRCUS TERMS: A small book that will teach you
      the cool words and phrases used by circus folk.
   3. MIRROR: Useful for putting on clown makeup (and for looking over
      your shoulder).
   4. PEPPY, YOUR PET SNAKE: Not necessarily useful, but you can take
      him everywhere with you (and you’re not sure you can trust your family to
      remember to feed him).
   5. CHOCOLATE BARS: You might want to take these along if you love
      chocolate. That way, you’ll be prepared if you get a craving.
   6. TALCUM POWDER: The professional trapeze artists use talcum to keep
      their hands from slipping when they grip the bars. You might want some if
      you plan to do any swinging.
   7. BAG OF PEANUTS: A tasty treat for you (and a good bribe for angry
      elephants).
   8. BUNCH OF BANANAS: Not only are they high in potassium, but the
      peels are useful if you want to get involved with the clown acts.
   9. YOUR LUCKY BASEBALL CAP: You wore it every day at circus camp.
      Nothing bad happened to you. You figure maybe the cap kept you safe.
   10. BALL OF TWINE: Useful for tying things together, reconnecting broken
      ropes, etc.
   11. BULLWHIP: A fifteen-foot-long leather whip might come in handy if you
      run into any lions or tigers on the loose!
After choosing three things, enter the circus!
