    You decide to go searching for Richie. You exit the clown tent through the
back. It leads into a small, dark tent that has candlelight flickering inside.
Soft, eerie violin music draws you in.
    A huge trunk full of glittering costumes stands open. You glimpse a
dressing table covered with candles. Seated next to the table is a small, bent-
backed gypsy. He looks about a hundred years old. He’s playing the violin.
   “Your friend is not here,” the gypsy announces.
   Weird. How did he know you were looking for someone?
   You shiver, wondering if this gypsy is friend or foe.
   But before you can ask him anything, you hear a growl.
   Behind you.
   All the hair on your neck stands on end.
